Classes are a fundamental component of object-oriented programming (OOP), and TypeScript includes them as a part of the language. 
They provide a great deal of flexibility in structuring your code.
Classes in TypeScript support features such as inheritance, interfaces, access modifiers, and more.

List of some features of classes.
1)Type Annotations
2)Access Modifiers
3)Constructors
4)Inheritance
5)Abstract Classes
6)Static Properties and Methods
7)Getters and Setters

example:-
class Greeter {
  greeting: string;

  constructor(message: string) {
	this.greeting = message;
  }

  greet() {
	console.log(`Hello, ${this.greeting}`);
  }
}

let greeter = new Greeter('TypeScript');
greeter.greet();
