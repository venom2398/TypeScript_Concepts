A module in TypeScript is a file containing code, where variables, functions, classes, or interfaces are exported and can be imported into other files. 
By using export and import keywords, modules can share or restrict access to specific elements between different files, ensuring better organization and modularity.

example:-

export function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}
---------
import { add } from './math';

console.log(add(4, 5)); // Outputs: 9
