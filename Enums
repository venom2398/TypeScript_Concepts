An enum (short for “enumeration”) is a special data type in TypeScript that allows you to define a set of named constants.
Enums make it easier to work with a group of related values and improve code readability and maintainability.

example: -
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT"
}

console.log(Direction.Up);    // Output: "UP"
console.log(Direction.Down);  // Output: "DOWN"
console.log(Direction.Left);  // Output: "LEFT"
console.log(Direction.Right); // Output: "RIGHT"

function move(direction: Direction) {
  console.log(`Moving ${direction}`);
}

move(Direction.Up);    // Output: Moving UP
move(Direction.Left);  // Output: Moving LEFT
