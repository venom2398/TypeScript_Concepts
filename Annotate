Annotate a function by specifying the types of its parameters and its return type. 
This helps catch errors at compile time and makes your code more predictable and easier to understand.

example: -
let add: (x: number, y: number) => number;

add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(add(2, 3));  // Outputs: 5
